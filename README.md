## Blogging Site(Pure PHP)

I crafting this project using PHP and mySql(msqli_connect).
In this project, it contain 2 section admin panel and user panel.
I used session to check logined acc is admin or user.
So admin can't asset to go user panel and user can't asset to admin panel too.
Admin can create Blog and manage users.
Blog contain image storage feature.
Also user acc and admin acc can change profile too.
And also I use manual pagination with PHP.

### In user panel
#### user can
- login logout
- read Blog
- comment Blog
- update profile
- manual pagination with PHP
